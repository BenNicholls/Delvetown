V0.1 TODO LIST

This will be the first functional little packaging of what delvetown is so far. The idea: one complete dungeon, however
simple. After this we can begin work on the town mode.

GOALS:
    1) Start screen, menu.
        - Some kind of title image [UI - bitmap drawing]
        - Menu items (New Game, High Scores, Quit)
    1) Make a dude.
        - Need to flesh out character stats
            - DnD stats? (STR AGI DEX INT WIS LCK)
            - PoE stats? (STR DEX INT)
            - Make up your own crap??? (COOL, AWE, DUDE)
        - Character creation screen 
    2) Enter the dungeon
        - Level Generator work
            - Need to reduce cases where significant parts are inaccessible [flood fill? A*?]
            - nicer looking... no more straight lines at the edges
            - intelligent placing of entrance/stairs
            - item generation + placing
        - Cave Entrance
            - light spilling in from outside... entrance closes behind you (maybe forcing you to light a torch??? coool)
    4) Fight some crap
        - More Enemies
            - Abandon the Butts and make some actual enemies. Standard rpg crap (rats, spiders, whatever)
                - Rats can be the BUTT SWARM:
                    - small semi-coordinated groups. follow the RAT KING  [ai - follow behaviour], [ai - choose targets, order subordinates]
                    - tiny on their own, easy to beat. introduce the swarms on level 2, 3, whatever for extra challenge
                - BUTTS can be like a gnoll or something:
                    - use weapons, pickup items, maybe use them??? [ai - item use] [ai - equipping stuff]
                    - drop stuff on death [game - inventory dropping]
                    - later levels: more gnolls? stronger? mmm
                - SUPER BUTTS:
                    - some kind of troll??
                    - huge, lots of health, big stick, but slow
                    - can throw allies at player (haha cool)
                - SOME KIND OF BOSS:
                    - I'm thinking some kind of.... magic user. get a spell in the game.
        - Make combat feel nicer!
            - Combat animations. [renderer/engine - animations]
            - Nicer log
                - Proper scrolling log
                - fading text as it gets older
                - colour coded log messages (white = mundane stuff, red = combat, green = item pickups??)
        - Ranged combat!
            - bow/sling/throwing combat
            - aiming [ui - glowing aiming line] [engine - multi-key actions]
            - projectile [ui - projectile animation along path] [engine - line drawing to calculate hit/miss]
    5) Buff out your dude
        - Lever Upparu!
            - experience for murdering helpless cave dwellers who were only minidng their own business
            - need to come up with levelling system:
                - on level, get +HP, +stat points, +ability points??
                    - ability points are conferred naturally, but bonus ones are given out for doing cool stuff
                        - ex: kill with a crit, one hit kill, pacifist for a whole level, stuff like that
                        - maybe different kinds of ability points? (offensive, defensive, stealth, etc)
                        - put ability points into special stats (gunmanship, quiet step, armoursmithing, whatever)
            - levels determine what kind of items you can use?? or stats??
        - items!
            - items have bases with a small range of stats (damage, attack speed, etc)
            - items can be magical somehow, i think with some kind of socket system
                - socket some magic crap in to add effects (fire, ice stone, make up some elements)
        - Powerups!
            - use-on-pickup powerups affect player (and enemies??) for short time. [engine - temporary effects]
                - speedup
                - attackup
                - other stuff?
            - make the user glow or something [ui - cool glowing]      
    6) Beat some kind of end boss
        - Like it sounds. 
        - Boss talks to you maybe? [engine - cutscene support? scripting??]
    7) High Score screen
        - Simple high scores, based on.... number of turns I guess??
        - Loading/saving of high scores
    8) End screen.
        - I'm thinking a big picture of a skull that laughs at you
        - hahaha skull
